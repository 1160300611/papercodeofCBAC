all the networks we use to analysis contain in the raw_data，Before use, these data must be preprocessed。
Due to the different inputs used by the network model， the method of preprocessing will make a difference between our method and the comparative experiment method.
for the GAT HAN MAGNN We must process the data in the my-data folder /preprocess.ipynb, and then copy the preprocessed folder to GAT HAN MAGNN method folder respectively.
and then you can run the Untitled.ipynb to start the model and use the metrics-Copy1.ipynb to analysis the result 
for our method just run in the following order preprocess->network_embdding->feature_extract->extract_Structure_feature->compareExperienment
